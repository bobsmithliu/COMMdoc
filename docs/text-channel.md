#### File upload

## Create a Text Channel

Sometimes you might have a page that you don't want to be indexed for the search nor to show up in search results, e.g, a 404 page. To exclude a page from search, add the `search_exclude: true` parameter to the page's YAML front matter:

### Setting up
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Page not found
nav_exclude: true
search_exclude: true
---
```
